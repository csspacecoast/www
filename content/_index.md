# What is Christian Science?

Mary Baker Eddy, who discovered and founded Christian Science, defined it as
"the law of God, the law of good..." ([Rudimental Divine
Science](https://mbeinstitute.org/Prose_Works/Rudimental_Divine_Science.html),
p. 1). In Christian Science, God is understood to be infinite Love, and so
invariably good that a clear glimpse of this through prayer has power to heal,
redeem, and restore anyone.

A lifelong student of the Bible, who yearned from her youth to find deeper
answers to the persistent question of human suffering, Mary Baker Eddy turned
wholeheartedly to God when she experienced a critical injury in 1866. As she
read accounts of Jesus’ swift, powerful healings, a new sense of God, Spirit, as
the true reality flooded her thought and healed her. Impelled to understand the
Principle behind this experience, she continued to search for and find in the
Bible the underlying laws of God that would form the basis of her teaching and
practice of Christian Science.

From her time to ours, many have found that when they understand their
relationship to God better through this Science of Christianity, their health is
restored and character transformed. And each healing inspires a heartfelt desire
to help others know and experience how loved we all are by God.
