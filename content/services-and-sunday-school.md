## Sunday Service

Our Sunday service is at <time datetime="10:00">10:00 am</time>.  This service
provides an atmosphere for prayer and for listening to a
[Bible Lesson](https://www.christianscience.com/publications-and-activities/bible-lessons)
that promotes healing.  The Bible Lesson is composed of citations from the Bible and
[Science and Health](https://www.christianscience.com/the-christian-science-pastor/science-and-health).
Each service includes hymn singing by the congregation and an inspirational solo.

## Wednesday Meeting

Join us for our Wednesday evening testimony meeting at <time
datetime="19:30">7:30 pm</time>. This meeting includes singing hymns and
listening to readings from the Bible and *Science and Health* on a 
timely subject. Those in attendance are invited to share testimonies or 
remarks on how they apply the teachings of Christian Science in 
their daily lives.

## Sunday School

Our Sunday School meets at <time datetime="10:00">10:00 am</time> and is open to
students under the age of 20. Sunday School instruction is based on the
Bibleâ€”beginning with the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer with its spiritual
interpretation, and the Sermon on the Mount.  In class, students learn of God's
love for them, and how the spiritual and moral teachings of the Bible and
*Science and Health* can help them every day, in every situation.

## Childcare

Infants and children who are too young to attend Sunday School are cared for 
lovingly in our Children's Room by an experienced adult.
